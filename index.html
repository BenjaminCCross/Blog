                        <p>Representation is always a problem in any field. Unfortunately, technology has been shown to
                            be one of the worst
                            industries for diversity. As a cis white male from an upper-middle-class background I fall
                            in the vast majority. This
                            has major ramifications on the kind of technology that is made and how effective it is. I am
                            more likely to be
                            interested in working on projects that would directly affect me and testing will only be
                            seen through the eyes of those
                            working on the projects till it is released. This was most notably seen in early computer
                            vision systems that often
                            could only recognize people of certain races because so many of the researchers looked so
                            similar.

                            OSS has been seen by many to be a solution to this. Unfortunately, it, too, has issues with
                            representation and does not
                            come solve many of the problems with representation effectively. The idea of meritocracy
                            suggests that the best
                            solutions bubble to the top and will be used and those who create them are justly rewarded
                            for that work. OSS, at a
                            glance, would seem to be a huge supporter of this. However, who gets to work on projects,
                            while no longer limited to who
                            is hired by a recruiter, is limited by the support a community gives to contributor and by
                            the freedom a contributor
                            has. Someone with a full-time job and kids is highly unlikely to work on an OSS project as
                            they simply don’t have time.
                            Furthermore, many women still feel like they can’t show accurate information about who they
                            are online and thus change
                            their profiles to be more gender neutral in appearance. So, while OSS makes strides to be
                            more representative, it still
                            falls short.

                            Many tech enthusiasts like understandably like to use technology as a solution to their
                            problems. Unfortunately, tech
                            can’t be the only answer to making tech more diverse. While systems like the IBM sentiment
                            analysis can be used to watch
                            for bias in some companies, basing who gets to take on opportunities exclusively by higher
                            scores leads to a clearly
                            segmented market. Clearer interviewing practices would help bridge this gap and allow
                            organizations to hire people with
                            new perspectives.

                            “It depends” -- quite possibly the worst answer to a question if not immediately followed by
                            an
                            explanation of the factors and what are needed. Software development is filled with this
                            answer and there
                            is no better example than in deciding on an architecture of a project. A project may work
                            extremely well
                            with one architecture but be near impossible to deliver using some other architecture. Then
                            understanding
                            the relative differences between architectures and how to implement them becomes vitally
                            important in
                            software development. If we see Software Architecture as the design of how different
                            components and
                            software interact with one another, there is a huge range of options. Deciding on which
                            architecture to
                            choose should be an ongoing discussion in a project but early on, making a decision for the
                            large-scale
                            architecture is important. While you can usually change the implementation down the line
                            with relative
                            ease, changing the entire architecture of a project can sometimes require a hard rewrite of
                            all the code.
                            It is for this reason that you must decide early on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, then how do you choose an architecture? First and foremost, it depends on the product
                            you are making.
                            Some projects will simply be easier to develop in one style versus another. For example,
                            take a network
                            stack. Most network stacks are a layered system where communication flows up and down the
                            stack of layers.
                            That isn’t to say it would be impossible to design one some other way, but it would be
                            easiest to design
                            it around a layering system. In addition to product however there are many “non-functional”
                            attributes.
                            These may include testing frameworks, security concerns, costs of maintenance, or
                            scalability. For
                            example, if security was a large concern, Event-based implicit invocation may not be the
                            best choice as
                            any information “broadcasted” may be picked up by any number of subscribers. There is no
                            “handshake” so
                            the publisher is relinquishing control of the computations, a possible security threat.
                            Every architecture
                            has it’s positives and negatives, and it is the job of the designer or PM to choose the
                            appropriate tool
                            for the job.

                            addressing version control as a system similar to Git. While there are other versions like
                            SVN, which we
                            will touch on at the end, Git’s copy-modify-merge structure and “one stop shopping” for
                            collaboration
                            makes it a good baseline to communicate effectively about version control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of the day, version control is simply a way of creating changes, collecting those
                            changes,
                            labeling them and publishing them. That last bit is where the magic really happens. Say you
                            have a file
                            “myAmazingCode.c” and you make, what you think to be, a revolutionary change to the code. So
                            you
                            understandably are tracking this file and your hordes of developers following this code are
                            delighted to
                            see you have pushed these changes to your github. They can fetch this code, allowing them to
                            see the
                            difference between your change and theirs. They can also attempt to merge your code with
                            their code.
                            Unfortunately, after testing your code they find it has completely ruined their code. The
                            wonderful aspect
                            of version control is that they can simply revert to a previous commit before they merged in
                            your changes.
                            So, no harm done. Moreover, they can be building on a separate branch and push their changes
                            to it, so as
                            to not harm your branch, and when their feature is complete merge their branch into master
                            on Github. This
                            incredible system of branching and merging means that while one developer is working on one
                            feature
                            another can be working on another feature independently but still be editing the same file.
                            Their changes
                            would then not impact each other until they attempt to merge, pulling each other’s code into
                            master or
                            their own branch to test integration.

                        <p>
                            A note on merging vs. rebasing. So far, I have exclusively talked about merging as the
                            operation to
                            connect one set of code with another. This however is a bit of a simplification. When
                            editing a file there
                            is a series of commit objects pointing down a tree. When merging, you are maintaining this
                            structure and
                            can see the history of the commits in the resulting merged code. Rebasing effectively does
                            the same thing,
                            however it does not maintain the history. When pulling the feature branch into the master,
                            instead of
                            seeing a list of commits from the feature branch, a developer can choose to “rewrite” (for
                            lack of a
                            better word) the history of the code being merged in as one large commit. Rebasing also has
                            the added
                            benefit of presenting the conflicts one commit at a time whereas a merge will present them
                            all at once.
                            So, when would you use one tool over another? Typically, a merge will do the trick. In most
                            cases, a
                            rebase is simply not necessary and maintaining the history of the code will help fix bugs
                            and track where
                            things may have gone wrong. A rebase, however, is not without its own merits. Rebasing
                            allows a developer
                            to simplify a large set of confusing commits into one easy to understand package. Both forms
                            have their
                            use cases and it is up to the developer to decide when one should be used over the other.

                            To close this post out a discussion on SVN vs Git is in order. Git, as described before, is
                            a
                            “copy-modify-merge” tool. That is, a file is copied not locked off from other users and
                            merged rather than
                            unlocked. This has the huge benefit of allowing multiple people to be working on the same
                            file in
                            different ways at the same time. In this way Git is a decentralized version control system.
                            It
                            dramatically increases developer’s “workspace”, meaning they can have any number of people
                            working on any
                            number of tasks in the same repository management without conflicting with one another. SVN
                            is in direct
                            opposition to Git in this way. It is a “lock-modify-unlock” tool. Because of this it would
                            be considered a
                            centralized version control system. When a developer wants to edit a file, they lock it off
                            from all other
                            developers. This restricts the workspace, as that file is now inaccessible. While SVN may be
                            wonderful in
                            a small team setting it makes no sense in a large open source software project.

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>A core problem that all open source projects need to face is how to get people to connect
                            with the
                            project. The project can’t exist without contributors, and there is no reason to build the
                            project without
                            users, so having ways to encourage those people to connect with the product is crucial for
                            its
                            development. There are a few ways of doing this. First and foremost, it comes from the
                            documentation. The
                            first impression anyone gets of a project is likely to be their homepage. Making sure that
                            it is clear
                            what the intent of the project is and how a someone can learn more is a great place to
                            start. This can
                            come in the form of a quick 3 sentence paragraph next to some images of the software. Having
                            this
                            immediately visible is extremely important. Beyond this, features lists, screenshots and
                            examples of use
                            cases help users know if this is the product for them and for developers to know that the
                            project already
                            has some feet under it. Of more importance to users than developers, is the getting started
                            page. Linked
                            to the homepage should be a page explaining how to start using the software, the best
                            projects often have
                            multiple versions, such as a fast setup, a video tutorial and a longer more in-depth
                            version.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that you have your first set of users, you need make sure your developer community is
                            organized.
                            Contributors don’t want to work on projects with no support structure. Fortunately, most
                            repositories come
                            with built in ways of keeping development organized. First is the issue tracker. Github
                            supports issue
                            tracking, with convenient labeling so if some developers feel better in some areas over
                            others, they can
                            tailor their work to their experiences, or rank issues in terms of severity. Additionally,
                            issues can be
                            tracked so it can go through from identification to closer, keeping everyone interested
                            appraised of its
                            status, and any further details needed can be requested in a forum like structure. Most
                            importantly for
                            large scale projects is removal of duplicates and fortunately, in Github you can flag an
                            issue as
                            duplicate and redirect to the original. All issue tracker should have these features, but
                            some projects
                            may elect to use outside trackers such as Jira.
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, developers need effective ways of communicating. IRC, Email, Blogs, Forums, Slack,
                            Discord. All
                            of these are useful tools but must be applied to the proper instances. For example, I
                            wouldn’t try to hold
                            a slack conversation over email, because no one should have that many emails flying around.
                            Conversely, I
                            wouldn’t use slack as an emailing service because it would be very difficult to track the
                            chain of
                            conversation. Having the proper communication channels available to developers helps them
                            problem solve
                            and collaborate even if they are on opposite sides of the planet.
                        </p>
                        <p>A good open source project makes sure that anyone interacting with the project can
                            efficiently get access
                            to the information they need without confusion. In some ways, the projects homepage should
                            be the most
                            important, least used aspect of the project. You want users to quickly pick up the project
                            and start
                            using, and you want developers to be able to navigate to the code or documentation or
                            communication
                            quickly, so they aren’t wasting their time

                        <p>Software, like many tools needs some form updating, fixing, or sharpening. In the case of
                            software this
                            come in the form of maintenance of code and expansion of features. What may be a simple
                            piece of code at
                            first, given enough development and focus can turn into a feature rich, complex, user
                            friendly piece of
                            software. This is one reason why a single vendor may open their software up to be open
                            source. By open
                            sourcing a software, a vendor may be able to add more eyes to a project and get a more
                            community driven
                            direction to its future, making it a better product for users. This may be wonderful for the
                            company as
                            they can have the benefit of a larger workforce while still being able to have a say in the
                            direction it
                            will proceed in.</p>
                        <p>However, opening up a software is not something you can undo and has several drawbacks to a
                            vendor. If
                            the community version of a software is built up enough, few users may see a need to purchase
                            an expensive
                            licensed copy of the software. By making an OSS, the single vendor is accepting that there
                            needs to be a
                            freely accessible version for developmental purposes. This doesn’t mean they won’t make
                            money off of it,
                            but in many cases, if it is not made in an accessible way, many developers may take control
                            and push to
                            make an alternative cheaper solution. Loss of control is a huge hurdle when starting an open
                            source
                            project. When there is a disagreement, the community has an enormous amount of power, and
                            once a project
                            is open, the community can continue without the single vendor if need be. So, in many ways,
                            the single
                            vendor must try to keep the community happy and connected.</p>
                        <p>This brings on questions regarding forkability. In a nutshell forkability is the ability for
                            any
                            developer to take an existing open source project, copy the code and begin working on a
                            competing project.
                            The possibility of a fork is a very powerful force in open source development, maybe more so
                            than the
                            actual action of forking itself. This is what makes sure the community works to build
                            consensus on
                            direction and no benevolent dictator becomes a real dictator. Should the community feel the
                            current master
                            isn’t fairly supporting their vision, they can abandon the dictator and current master and
                            take the
                            project in a different direction.
                            This would be considered a hard fork, and from a single vendor perspective they should be
                            concerned. If
                            there is enough frustration, then by forking, the vendor would be losing most if not all
                            control over the
                            project. Forking however has it’s drawbacks. It not only hurts the vendor but also the
                            developers and
                            users, as a fork would be dividing the community, users and contributors in two. Meaning
                            there are less
                            people supporting the software in both branches. Additionally, any community engagement
                            tools or
                            infrastructure unique to the master would then need to be recreated for the new fork. So,
                            forking is a
                            costly power only to be wielded when there is strong support.

                            There are clearly many schools of thought on the structure of software development. It’s
                            clear that there
                            isn’t necessarily a single way of doing it and that these structures can mix somewhat but
                            that there are
                            distinct characteristics depending on the method used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two such structures that are seemingly at odds are the Cathedral and the Bazaar models. In
                            software
                            development these models. As addressed in our class discussion these two methods both have
                            pros and cons.
                            Many of the pros to the bazaar method are based around its size. With so many people taking
                            part, many
                            eyes mean a higher chance of someone spotting a bug, not to mention simply having more
                            people means more
                            working hours put into the project. However, these come at some costs that a smaller
                            cathedral model is
                            better at addressing. With a clear structured hierarchy in the cathedral model, large
                            structural changes
                            can happen much more smoothly as it is easier to make sure everyone is on the same page.
                            Additionally, it
                            is easy to accidentally duplicate work in a bazaar model whereas a cathedral model, tasks
                            can be doled out
                            and managed much more efficiently. Again, this is not to say one is better than the other,
                            simply that one
                            is easier to use in some circumstances than another. With a large community, the cathedral
                            model becomes
                            cumbersome, however, to start a bazaar model, there needs to be a lot of infrastructure to
                            properly direct
                            a varied community. Not to mention using the proper tools and documentation can mitigate the
                            downsides of
                            choosing one model over another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            None of the above structures matter to a project without first opening it up to the public.
                            This brings
                            out questions on the philosophy and even ethics of software. It would appear Richard
                            Stallman would argue
                            that the best software is open source and to be open you must obey the four freedoms.
                            Namely: 1) the
                            freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose; 2) the freedom to study how the
                            program works,
                            and change it so it does your computing as you wish; 3) the freedom to redistribute copies
                            so you can help
                            your neighbour; and lastly, 4) the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
                            others. The
                            way a software is licensed will either allow or not allow for these freedoms. Calling a
                            software
                            “proprietary” is saying that the licensing somehow breaks these four crucial freedoms. By
                            making
                            proprietary software, you are making much easier to monetize, as the rights are then held
                            under company or
                            some other legal entity. This monetization aspect, while not exclusive to proprietary
                            software, then
                            allows for practices that are not user friendly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isn’t to say that proprietary software doesn’t have its place. Technology companies
                            need financial
                            support and having users pay to access their software is an understandable solution to this.
                            Furthermore,
                            this direct stream of money allows more of the funding to go directly into supporting the
                            software
                            development process and to pay developers for their services. That being said, I agree with
                            Stallman at
                            least to the point where I believe most software should at least have a feature rich FOSS
                            alternative.
                            Like how photoshop is impressive and extremely useful, you can do most things in GIMP, a
                            FOSS alternative.
