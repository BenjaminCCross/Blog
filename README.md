# Blog
This Blog is being created in response to the Dickinson College senior seminar. Following posts will be reflective writings on the readings and discussions on topics of open source software (FOSS), software engineering and contemporary social and ethical issues in technology.

I plan on going into industry. I have a few offers from previous summer internships, though I am still shopping around find a job that will help me broaden my experience and skills. I feel due to my past experiences I have started to pigeon hole myself, and I want to ensure I keep learning new technologies and entering new fields.
